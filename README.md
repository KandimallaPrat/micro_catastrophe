This github repository is part of the Caltech Fall 2020 [Bi103a Team 31 Catastrophe Project](https://kratargon.github.io/bi103g31/index.html). Github repository for the website can be found [here](https://github.com/Kratargon/bi103g31).

# Organization of the Code
--------------------------
* `cat_analysis` contains the main python package. 
* `data` contains the datasets (original and tidied) used in the analyses.
* `figures` contains the figures generated as part of the analyses (as described on our [website](https://kratargon.github.io/bi103g31/index.html). This could be used as a template to see how your figures will turn out when you use different functions in the package.
* `main`: The main folder also contains the scripts we used to generate the plots. This could be used as a template to analyze your own data.
